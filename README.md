# PotatoWatch

Our Potato Watch helps the hearing-impaired. When a different person says the hotword, "Hey Potato", the wearable device (includes Dragon, Arduino, motor...) activates the motor which sends vibrations to the person wearing it. Our team designed, prototyped and programmed this product to help the hearing-impaired community.
